Command-line Tool and C library for SpringCard Prox'N'Roll RFID Scanner
=======================================================================

This project has been inspired (and is actually based on) the software accompanying blink(1): https://github.com/todbot/blink1

It has been compiled and tested on Ubuntu 14.04, MacOS X Yosemite, Windows 7 (using Visual C++ Express 2010) and RaspberryPi (Raspbian Distro).
Binaries for these platforms could be downloaded directly from the page: http://tech.springcard.com/2014/rfidscan-tool-driving-your-proxnroll-rfid-scanner-leds-and-buzzer/

To build, see the Makefile.

The current support build products are:

- `rfidscan-tool` -- command-line tool for controlling the RFID Scanner (drive the LEDs / buzzer, read or write the non-volatile configuration)
- `rfidscan-lib` -- C library
